This is my .vim folder.

It started as a fork of http://github.com/carlhuda/janus, but I suspect that it will
diverge quite a bit as my vim powers increase.

Have fun with it. Everything should work whether in gui or terminal mode, but
you'll need a terminal capable of doing xterm-256color.  (Mac users: get iTerm.)

Run "make" to install it.
